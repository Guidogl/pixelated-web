    <h2>Your Name</h2>
    <p>Gvidas Glebas</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Every time I take a look at some portfolio websites, I see a unique
      representation of the person behind it. I wanted to create a portfolio
      that would be simple, yet innovative. I chose to implement a simple
      structure with a few sections that would allow me to showcase my passion
      for creative industries. The homepage doesn't have traditional navigation
      but it has animations that are triggered by scrolling. I use GSAP library
      for this. The homepage is also unique because it has a pixelated art that
      is created purlely with CSS. After entering each card, user can see a
      simple structure of the page with title, description, media (image, video
      or 3D file) and a footer with navigation. Also, user can close the card.
      This represents more traditional javascript implementation. The project
      structure is simple with seperate folders for assets and pages.
    </p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The design inspiration came form the popular design portoflio site [1].
        The idea was to recreate the pixelated website in a similar way but with
        a different color scheme and animations.
      </li>
      <img src="/assets//design-inspiration.jpg" alt="design" />
      <li>Animation idea came for the GSAP library of exmaples [2].</li>
      <li>Pixel art ideas came from the wbsite that I found on Google [3].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Text and background colors have good contrast, thus they can be easily
        read. Dark background with light text is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        The website incorporates animations to guide users through the
        interface. A downward-facing arrow subtly suggests that users should
        scroll to reveal additional content.
      </li>
      <li>
        The text is large and changes the size based on the screen size.
        Responsive website suited for small and large screens.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The animations are triggered intuitively by scrolling, providing a
        natural and engaging user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigation is included in the pages to help user enter different pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pixel art is in CSS only. This means that they can load much faster
        without additional connection to server and file downloading like in the
        pages with images and 3D file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I had to learn how to make CSS responsive. Pixel art has static
        hardcoding of pixel color and location on the screen. In the beggining,
        it was hard to change the that and I was considering using AI to change
        the pixels to em but the CSS was too long. Later, I was considering
        chaning the format but then I found a solution to scale the CSS with
        <code>transform: scale(0.5)</code> [4] and it worked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another important learning was about animation library. I had to look
        for information on how to add it to the project and how to deal with
        elements that are not on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Importing font that is suitable for the idea was also good and important
        learning. I had look for fonts on the interent [5] and then use
        <code>import url()</code>
        css to add it the document.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
      I am most proud about how external libraries are implemented on the
      website. There is a library for animations but also there is a libarary
      for handling 3D files. And particulary the library with 3D implementation
      was interesing because I leared about custom html tags.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <p>
      Navigation could be improved. It is not very intuitive because the
      homepage doesn't have typical navigation bar. However, I find that
      portfolio webistes are usually have unique perspectives. Also, the
      resposivess doesn't include mobile phones and they are very important in
      current environment.
